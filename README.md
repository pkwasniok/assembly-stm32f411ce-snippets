# About
I wanted to get into bare metal embedded development so I started creating some useful snippets for handling different peripherals on STM32f411CE.

# Usage
To run snippet on your own device, first you need to make sure that everything is properly connected and that you have [OpenOCD](https://openocd.org/), [ARM toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/GNU%20Toolchain) and [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) installed on your computer. The you simply need to cd into selected snippet directory and run `make` command.
Currently snippets only work with [ST-Link](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/st-link-v2.html) programmer.
